## Installation 🔧⚙️

The program is written in Python 3. To run the program, follow these steps:

1.Install Python 3 🐍 on your system.

2.Open a command prompt or terminal.

3.Navigate to the directory where the program file is saved.

4.Type "python filename.py" 📃 to run 🏃‍♂️ the program .
## Usage ✈️
1.The program will ask ❓ you to enter either "encrypt" or "decrypt" as the action you want to perform.

2.If you enter "encrypt", the program will encrypt the message that you provide using the key 🔑 length you specify.

3.If you enter "decrypt", the program will decrypt the message 💠 that you provide using the key length you specify.

4.The program will ask you to enter the key length in numbers. The key length determines the number of positions each character is shifted to encrypt or decrypt the message 〽️.

5.After entering the key length, the program will ask you to enter the message to be encrypted or decrypted 🔰.

6.The program will then perform the encryption or decryption process, and the result will be displayed as outpu ✔️.

7.If you enter "end" as the action to perform, the program will terminate.
